# Project-1
IEEE Screen Coding for Drawer.
This is a project in which we will be making screen demos, for different sections of the Drawer.
While we are doing these demos, we will use this first project to learn to use github as a group and to get to know each other better.
https://discord.gg/zFPS4G <- This is the discord server, for us to communicate better among our group. This forms another way to contact and share 
ideas so there shouldn't be a reason for us to not do so.
